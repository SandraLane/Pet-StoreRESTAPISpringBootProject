# Pet-StoreRESTAPISpringBootProject
This is a petStore RESTAPI project which uses Maven and has a Spring Boot main class which starts Spring Boot and configures itself as a Web application.  
The application also has a modified POM.XML file with content created in the Spring Inializr Website.  An entitiy relationship diagram was created using draw.io and
the entities were created using JPA (Java Persistence API) and can be used by Spring JPA to configure schema tables with entity relationships.  
The application is a multi-layer application which uses an input/output layer (controller class - where data is transformed from JSON into JAVA objects (DTO)), 
the service layer - where transactions are managed and from the DTOs into JPA entities, and the data layer interface (Data Access Object layer) - where Spring JPA
implements SQL code that will perform CRUD operations.
